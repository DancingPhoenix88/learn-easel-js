# learn-easel-js
[EaselJS 0.7.1](https://www.createjs.com/easeljs) experiments

Run `index.html` to access experiments. Details:

- `draw_circle.html`: Get started with EaselJS, try to setup a stage and draw a circle on it
- `zindex.html`: Draw 3 overlapped circles to see how drawing order affects sorting order on final rendering
- `animation.html`: Move a circle by re-drawing it every frame at new position
- `tween.html`: Move a circle by using Tween library
- `bitmap_animation.html`: Test sprite-sheet animation with equal sprites
- `sprite_animation_2.html`: Test sprite-sheet animation with unequal sprites
- `sprite_inspector.html`: Tool to define frames in a sprite-sheet (dynamic pivot is supported)
- `sprite_animation_gui.html`: Tool to define animations (which sprite-sheet, which frames, frame rate, events)
- `state_machine_gui.html`: Tool to define a StateMachine (states, transitions between states with conditions)
- `state_machine.html`: Test combining sprite-sheet animation with a draft version of StateMachine controller
- `sprite_prototype.html`: Sprite-sheet animation & StateMachine
- `input.html`: Use keyboard to control character (Testing Input system)
- `culling.html`: Implement manual occlusion culling
- `multi_canvas.html`: Separate animated & static sprites to multiple canvases to reduce re-draw

My experiments are inspired by character Zero in the famous game Rockman X4.
